      # Pre-commit runs pyright-python in its own virtual environment by
      # default which means it does not detect installed dependencies. The
      # virtual env can be specified in pyrightconfig.json via the "venvPath"
      # and "venv" variables. However, this doesn't seem to work with
      # conda/mamba environments and is less robust anyway.
